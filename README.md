This is the homepage for the BeeWare project.

It is a [Lektor](https://getlektor.com)-based site.

If you want to contribute a modification, you can fork this repository and
submit a pull request.

If you want to test out a change before you submit it, download and install
Lektor; then from the root directory of the checkout, run:

This will [start a webserver](http://127.0.0.1:8000) that will autoreload
whenever you make a change to site content.
