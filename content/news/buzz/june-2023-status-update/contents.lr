We're half way through the year! Work on the widget audit is almost complete; but that's not all we've been working on.

What we've done
----------------

* We've completed the audit of `NumberInput <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1946>`__,  `WebView <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1949>`__, `DateInput, TimeInput <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1951>`__, `ImageView <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1956>`__ and `Selection <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1955>`__ on all platforms; and we've completed the audit of `ScrollContainer <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1969>`__ `SplitContainer <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1984>`__, `OptionContainer <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1996>`__, `Table <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2011>`__ and `Tree <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2017>`__ on macOS, iOS and GTK.

* We've identified and resolved some `edge cases in the Pack layout algorithm <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1958>`__.

* We've `improved the implementation of application paths, and audited the paths being returned on all platforms <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1964>`__.

* We `corrected some issues in the Web backend caused by the most recent PyScrip and Pyodide releases <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/2008>`__.

* We've `improved the error message that is returned when a widget isn't implemented on a platform <https://github.com/beeware/toga/pull/1992>`__.

* We've updated Briefcase to `use Java 17 when building Android projects <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1271>`__.

* We've added support for the `ANDROID_HOME environment variable <https://github.com/beeware/briefcase/pull/1307>`__ when building Android projects with a pre-existing copy of Android Studio. 

What's next?
--------------

The widget testing audit has been a mammoth project, but the end is very nearly in sight. There's only 2 widget (Canvas and DetailedList) that haven't seen any testing to date; plus there's some non-widget features (like dialogs, fonts, windows, and basic App functionality) that still require testing. Once those tests are complete, we'll be moving on to dealing with some iOS and Android deployment issues that have been accumulating while we focussed on Toga.

We'll also be at `EuroPython 2023 <http://europython.eu>`__ from July 17-23. We're presenting on Thursday; and we'll be there for the full duration of the sprints. See you in Prague!
