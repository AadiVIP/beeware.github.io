body:

To develop a cross platform desktop app, you need to use a cross platform widget toolkit - `Toga`_. Toga abstracts away the differences between the various platforms, providing a common Python API for app development.

On macOS, this API uses the capabilities of `Rubicon`_ to access native system libraries. Rubicon is a bridge library that gives you transparent access to all the native Objective C classes that iOS provides. On Linux, native Python bindings for GTK+ are used. On Windows, ctypes is used to call Win32 C APIs directly.

Once you've written your mobile application, you can use `Briefcase`_ to package your Python code for specific platforms. Briefcase takes the distutils `setup.py` definition for your Python project, and uses that metadata to generate a stub project, compile your Python code, and place the compiled artefacts so that they will be found when you run the app. The stub project is generated using the `Python macOS template`_.
